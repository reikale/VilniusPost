                <div class="post__body">
                    <p class="post__content">
                        In a culture obsessed with measuring talent and ability, we often overlook the important role of inspiration. Inspiration awakens us to new possibilities by allowing us to transcend our ordinary experiences and limitations. Inspiration propels a person from apathy to possibility, and transforms the way we perceive our own capabilities. Inspiration may sometimes be overlooked because of its elusive nature. Its history of being treated as supernatural or divine hasn’t helped the situation. But as recent research shows, inspiration can be activated, captured, and manipulated, and it has a major effect on important life outcomes.</p>

                    <p> Inspiration has three main qualities. Pyschologists Todd M. Thrash and Andrew J. Elliot have noted these core aspects of inspiration: evocation, transcendence, and approach motivation. First, inspiration is evoked spontaneously without intention. Inspiration is also transcendent of our more animalistic and self-serving concerns and limitations. Such transcendence often involves a moment of clarity and awareness of new possibilities. As Thrash and Elliot note, “The heights of human motivation spring from the beauty and goodness that precede us and awaken us to better possibilities.” This moment of clarity is often vivid, and can take the form of a grand vision, or a “seeing” of something one has not seen before (but that was probably always there). Finally, inspiration involves approach motivation, in which the individual strives to transmit, express, or actualize a new idea or vision. According to Thrash and Elliot, inspiration involves both being inspired by something and acting on that inspiration.</p>

                <h1 class="post__title">Measuring Human Progress</h1>
                <div class="post__body">
                    <p class="post__content">
                        African American men in California can expect to live fewer than 73 years—about the same as the life expectancy of men in Tunisia and Vietnam, countries with far fewer health care resources. Meanwhile, Asian American men in California can expect to live 84.4 years, a life expectancy that bests that of men living in global-well-being-nirvana Sweden by four years. These gaps and others as vast within California rival those that separate the richest and poorest nations. Why don’t we know more about these kinds of disparities—disparities in something so fundamental as being alive?

                        Americans hear about Gross Domestic Product growth every quarter, retail sales statistics monthly, and stock market figures every 15 seconds. But those economic indicators measure how the economy is faring, not what life is like for ordinary Americans. Using financial indicators alone as a measure of how well Californians, Americans, or indeed any group of people globally, are doing, is insufficient. Worse, it can give misleading signals. By that score, residents of California’s Kern County, which produced $6.2 billion in agricultural output in 2012 alone, should be thriving. Yet one in three children in Kern County lives in poverty, and Kern ranks near the bottom of the list of California counties in terms of human well-being. Metrics that shed light on the lot of everyday people are more relevant gauges of progress than the purely economic metrics that are a constant focus of our attention today.
                        
                        Measure of America’s American Human Development (HD) Index measures well-being and access to opportunity in communities across the United States. The index is a composite measure of health, education, and standard of living adapted from the well-honed and widely referenced Human Development Index developed at the United Nations and informed by Nobel Laureate economist Amartya Sen’s capabilities approach. We have applied it to a range of places and groups including US states, congressional districts, metro areas, counties, neighborhoods, and census tracts, as well as racial and ethnic groups and women and men. The results have helped stimulate more fact-based conversations about the challenges faced by communities across the country.

                    <p class="post__content">Health, education, and earnings matter, and making even modest improvements in one area can have a ripple effect across the complete human development spectrum. With that in mind, we have an agenda for action that will help Californians build the capabilities that foster well-being and expand opportunities.</p>

                <div class="post__body">
                    <p class="post__content">Karantinas dar labiau pagreitino ir taip sparčiai vykstančius skaitmenizacijos procesus, mat sulėtėjus veiksmui realiame pasaulyje, pasaulis tiesiog kūlvirsčiais metėsi į elektroninę erdvę. Iš to neabejotinai išlošia tie, kurie ten jaučiasi geriausiai – tai programuotojai ir kiti IT specialistai, kurių profesijos jau ir taip ne vienerius metus vadinamos „auksinėmis“.

                        Pasak buvusio ISM rektoriaus Nerijaus Pačėsos, akivaizdu, kad pasaulis skaitmenizuojasi ir dar akivaizdžiau, kad šie procesai nežada sustoti. Tai patvirtina ir ši krizinė situacija, kai skaitmeniniai sprendimai tampa dar aktualesni, o IT darbo vietos – vienos vertingiausių. „Esame globalioje skaitmenizavimosi bangoje ir tik nuo mūsų priklausys, kiek mes tos pasaulinės rinkos užimsime. Tai priklauso ir nuo IT įmonių, bet ne mažiau – ir nuo IT talentų rengimo“, – įsitikinęs N.Pačėsa</p>
